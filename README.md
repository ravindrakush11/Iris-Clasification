# Iris-Clasification
**Problem:** Classifying the species (Setosa, Virginica, Versicolor) of the flowers on the basis given input measurement such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

The Iris dataset is a popular and widely used dataset in the field of machine learning and data analysis. It contains measurements of various attributes of different species of Iris flowers. This dataset was first introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in 1936 and has since become a standard benchmark for classification algorithms.

The Iris dataset consists of 150 instances, each representing an individual Iris flower. Each instance has four features/attributes:
1.  Sepal Length: The measurement of the length of the sepal (the outer whorl of the flower) in centimeters.
2. Sepal Width: The measurement of the width of the sepal in centimeters.
3. Petal Length: The measurement of the length of the petal (the inner whorl of the flower) in centimeters.
4. Petal Width: The measurement of the width of the petal in centimeters.

Based on these four features, each instance in the dataset is labeled with one of three different species of Iris flowers:
1. Setosa
2. Versicolor
3. Virginica

The goal of using the Iris dataset is typically to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify new Iris flowers based on their measurements into one of the three species.

The Iris dataset is often used for tasks such as classification, clustering, and data visualization. It is considered an ideal dataset for learning and practicing various machine learning algorithms due to its simplicity, small size, and well-defined classes.

**Optimum Iris Classification of the Cluster**

Steps:
1. Importing all the required libraries
2. Reading the Dataset
3. Data Summarization
4. Data Visualization
5. Splitting the Dataset into Training and Testing
6. Predicting the Species on the basis of given features
